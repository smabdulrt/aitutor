lets look at the file for our To-dos and wrap then up one by one. Keep making the human test each task manually and getting an OK from them before you mark it [DONE] and decide to move on.

------ TO DO ------
1. QUESTIONS TEMPLATE: Look at /Users/vandanchopra/Vandan_Personal_Folder/CODE_STUFF/Projects/aitutor/prototypes/perseus -- This is khan academy's questions display template. It's a nice clean approach. However, i don't want to use their code base. I'd rather use this as a starting point and create my own code base. I like the clean formatting they use, so lets retain that. Lets crate our own version of this. 

    **Continuity Note (Self):** Phase 1 of the SherlockED system is complete and has been manually verified by the user. The core backend architecture, API, and frontend rendering system are in place for our initial three widget types (multiple-choice, free-response, numeric-input). The next step is to begin **Phase 2: Iterative Expansion with Advanced Widgets**, starting with **Sprint 1: Classification and Ordering Widgets**.

    Here is the detailed to-do list, in the order I will perform the work:
        
        Phase 1: Build and Test the Core Widget & Skill System
            * Goal: To build a robust, reusable system for rendering basic interactive questions and processing their answers to update user skills. This phase will deliver a complete, end-to-end product for our three core
                question types.
            1. Architect the Backend for Multiple Widget Types:
                * Action: I will update the Question data model in the DASH system to include a question_type field (e.g., "multiple-choice") and a flexible widget_data field to hold all the unique information a specific widget
                    needs.
            2. Populate a Rich, Multi-Type Curriculum:
                * Action: I will significantly expand the curriculum.json file. I will add 10 new `multiple-choice` questions, 10 new `free-response` questions, and 10 new `numeric-input` questions, distributing them across
                    various skills.
            3. Implement a Smart Answer-Validation API: [DONE]
                * Action: I will create a single, intelligent POST /submit-answer API endpoint. This endpoint will use a new check_answer method in the DASH system that reads the question's type and applies the correct validation
                    logic for our initial three types.
            4. Build the `SherlockED` Frontend Renderer: [DONE]
                * Action: I will create the main SherlockED React component. This component will act as a "widget dispatcher"â€”its primary job is to read the question_type from the API data and dynamically render the correct widget
                    component.
            5. Develop the Initial Set of Core Widgets: [DONE]
                * Action: I will build the first three fundamental interactive widgets: MultipleChoiceDisplay.tsx, FreeResponseDisplay.tsx, and NumericInputDisplay.tsx.
                * Action: I will implement the full user interaction loop within SherlockED, handling answer submission to the API and displaying "Correct" or "Incorrect" feedback.
            6. Integrate and Verify the Core System:
                * Action: I will replace the old question display component with the new SherlockED component in the main app layout.
                * Action: I will ask you to perform a full manual test of the core system with our three initial widget types to ensure the entire loop is working perfectly.

        Phase 2: Iterative Expansion with Advanced Widgets
            * Goal: To iteratively build out the full suite of advanced, Perseus-style widgets, leveraging the proven foundation from Phase 1.
            Sprint 1: Classification and Ordering Widgets (categorizer, sorter, orderer, matcher)
            Sprint 2: Graphing and Data Visualization Widgets (grapher, plotter, interactive-graph, number-line)
            Sprint 3: Advanced Mathematical Input Widgets (expression, matrix)
            * Actions for Each Sprint:
                1. Backend: Add 10 new sample questions to curriculum.json for each of the new widget types in the sprint.
                2. Frontend: Create the corresponding React widget components.
                3. Integration: Update the SherlockED renderer and the backend check_answer method to support the new widgets.

        Phase 3: Final Polish
            7. Comprehensive System Review:
                * Action: After all sprints are complete, I will ask you to perform a final, comprehensive test of the entire system, verifying that every single widget type functions correctly from end to end.
