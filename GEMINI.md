lets look at the file for our To-dos and wrap then up one by one. Keep making the human test each task manually and getting an OK from them before you mark it [DONE] and decide to move on.

------ TO DO ------
1. Curriculum Builder:
Start with creating a new branch forking from 'staging' branch. New branch name should be "feature/curriculum-builder"
read /Users/vandanchopra/Vandan_Personal_Folder/CODE_STUFF/Projects/aitutor/khanacademyscrapper.md and help me write a python based browser that listen and extracts the question json as mentioned. I will do the browsing manually, and i want the script to keep saving question jsons.

2. QUESTIONS TEMPLATE: 

3. IXL Skill Expansion:

4. SherlockED Template Expansion
        Phase 2: Iterative Expansion with Advanced Widgets
            * Goal: To iteratively build out the full suite of advanced, Perseus-style widgets, leveraging the proven foundation from Phase 1.
            Sprint 1: Classification and Ordering Widgets (categorizer, sorter, orderer, matcher)
            Sprint 2: Graphing and Data Visualization Widgets (grapher, plotter, interactive-graph, number-line)
            Sprint 3: Advanced Mathematical Input Widgets (expression, matrix)
            * Actions for Each Sprint:
                1. Backend: Add 10 new sample questions to curriculum.json for each of the new widget types in the sprint.
                2. Frontend: Create the corresponding React widget components.
                3. Integration: Update the SherlockED renderer and the backend check_answer method to support the new widgets.

        Phase 3: Final Polish
            7. Comprehensive System Review:
                * Action: After all sprints are complete, I will ask you to perform a final, comprehensive test of the entire system, verifying that every single widget type functions correctly from end to end.
